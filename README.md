## Build instructions

### 1) Compile native libraries using the "build_nativelibs.py" script

- In order to compile wasm native libs, Emscripten 4.0.12 is required
- In order to compile Android native libs, NDK 27 is required

### 2) Generate the bindings using "Generate-Bindings.ps1"

### 3) Generate the nugets using "Generate-Bindings.ps1"

The is a github action to build the nugets, but it doesn't compile the native libraries.
